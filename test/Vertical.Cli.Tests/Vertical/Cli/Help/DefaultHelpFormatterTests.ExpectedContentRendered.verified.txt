Description:
  grep searches PATTERNS in each FILE. PATTERNS is one or more patterns
  separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a
  pattern. Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep is used in a shell
  command.

Usage:
  grep [options] 

Options:
  --basic-regexp, -G         Interpret PATTERNS as basic regular expressions
                             (BREs, see below). This is the default.
  -e, --regexp <REGEXP>...   Use PATTERNS as the patterns.  If this option is
                             used multiple times or is combined with the -f
                             (--file) option, search for all patterns given. 
                             This option can be used to protect a pattern
                             beginning with “-”.
  -E, --extended-regexp      Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions
                             (EREs, see below).
  -f, --file <FILE>...       Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this
                             option is used multiple times or is combined with
                             the -e (--regexp) option, search for all patterns
                             given. The empty file contains zero patterns, and
                             therefore matches nothing. If FILE is - , read
                             patterns from standard input.
  -F, --fixed-strings        Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular
                             expressions.
  -i, --ignore-case          Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input
                             data, so that characters that differ only in case
                             match each other.
